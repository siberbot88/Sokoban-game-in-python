- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

---

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sokoban-python.git
   cd sokoban-python
   ```

2. **Install Pygame**:

## Customizing Levels

You can create your own levels by modifying the `level_data` array in the `sokoban.py` file. Here's how the symbols work:

- `#`: Wall
- `.`: Storage location
- `@`: Player
- `$`: Box
- `*`: Box on a storage location
- `+`: Player on a storage location

Example level:
```python
level_data = [
    "###########",
    "#    #    #",
    "#   .$.  .#",
    "#    @  ###",
    "###########",
]
```
